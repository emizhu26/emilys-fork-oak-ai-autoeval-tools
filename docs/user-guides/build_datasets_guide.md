# AutoEval User Documentation: Build Datasets
This page allows you to create and manage datasets by selecting and saving subsets of lesson plans for evaluation.

### 1. Setting Up Your Dataset
- **Dataset Title**: In the text input box labeled "Enter a dataset title for the Eval UI (e.g. history_ks2)", provide a descriptive title for your dataset. This title will help you identify your dataset when you come to run evaluations on it.
- **Creator's Name**: In the text input box labeled "Enter your name", enter your name. This information will be stored as part of the dataset details.

### 2. Filtering Lesson Plans
- **Keyword Search**: In the text input box labeled "Enter keyword for generation details", provide a keyword that will enable you to filter lesson plans based on the generation details you provided when uploading your lesson plan data. This will help narrow down the lesson plans to those relevant to your dataset.
- **Retrieve Lesson Plans**: Click the "Get Lesson Plans" button to search for lesson plans that match the provided keyword. The matching lesson plans will be displayed in a table.

### 3. Viewing and Selecting Lesson Plans
After clicking the "Get Lesson Plans" button, the retrieved lesson plans will be displayed in a table. You can review the lesson plans to ensure they meet your criteria.

### 4. Saving the Dataset
- **Save Sample**: Click the "Save Sample with Selected Lesson Plans" button to save the selected lesson plans to a new or existing sample. The following actions will be performed:
- **Creating a New Sample**: If you have provided a dataset title and your name, a new sample will be created.
- **Linking Lesson Plans**: The selected lesson plans will be linked to the new sample.
- **Note**: Ensure that all required fields (dataset title and creator's name) are filled before saving.

### 5. Clearing the Cache
- **Clear Cache**: Use the "Clear Cache" button in the sidebar to clear the application cache. This can help resolve any issues related to cached data.

### Example Workflow
